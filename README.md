# WikiBot
Made with Selenium, this script fetches the inner HTML of a random Wikipedia article, processes it, and uploads the resulting text snippet to Twitter. Tweets are sent out every 3-8 seconds, only limited by Twitter's hourly tweet ceiling. For a demonstration, see @WikiBot2 on twitter: https://twitter.com/WikiBot2
